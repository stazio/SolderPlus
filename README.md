What is SolderPlus?
-------------
SolderPlus is a continuation of [TechnicSolder](http://docs.io).
SolderPlus fixes many issues with the older solder, and implements a better workflow.

Why Did I Continue It?
--------------
I feel as if TechnicSolder had a lot of issues with workflow, and must-have features that were never implemented.
It was also extremely difficult for the less-technical-minded people to setup.

Requirements
-------------
* PHP 5.5+
* PHP MCrypt Extension
* PHP Curl Extension
* PHP GD Extension
* A SQLlite, mysql, pgsql, or sqlsrv database
* Curl

Installation
-------------
Installation is easy! Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/stazio/SolderPlus/releases).
Extract the zip into the root of your server.
**Note** that the *public* folder should be the main folder for production. 
On some servers it could be called *public_html* or *htdocs*. Rename it accordingly.

Then, simply run through the installer!  


Dev Installation
----------------
Run the following command. 
```text
git clone https://github.com/stazio/SolderPlus.git
cp app/config-sample app/config
composer install --no-dev
```
To serve run ```php artisan serve```.

Now you will need to copy an API key from the [TechnicPlatform](https://www.technicpack.net/login).

Your name in the corner -> Edit my profile -> Solder Configuration.

Copy the API key into the Configure Solder -> API Key Management page.

Now you are free to use Solder with your modpacks! Enjoy!
